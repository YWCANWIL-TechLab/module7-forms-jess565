            <h1>Exercise 2: Form Attributes</h1>
            <p>
                Form attributes can enhance our abilities of our forms. Form attributes let you begin
                to validate your user input without having to use JavaScript.

                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form1. Ask the user 
                for their first and last name using text inputs. The first name should have a default value of 
                "John" and the last name should have a default value of "Doe". You can create this using the 
                value attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form2. Ask the user

            <p>

                to enter a username with a text input. You should also have a password input, but it should use 
                the readonly attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form4. Ask the user
                for a review using a textarea element. Make sure the textarea is at least 50 characters wide.

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form6. Ask the user 
                for any date that happened during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The US considered it an emergency from 
                Jan 31, 2020 to May 11, 2023. Using the min and max attributes, restrict the user's choices to 
                that range of dates.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form7. Ask the user
                for all the HTML files of the current website they are on. You can ask for a file with a file
                input, but you will need to use the multiple attribute to allow multiple files to be selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form8. Ask the user
                for a question to search using a search input. Create a placeholder to ask them for their question.

            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form10. Ask the user
                to select a number between 0 and 100. You should accept input as a slider by creating a range element.
                You should set min and max attributes so that the lowest number is 0 and the highest number is 100. 
                You should set the step attribute as well so that they can only select numbers divisible by 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form11. Ask the user
                to enter their first and last name again using text inputs. Instead of a submit button, use an 
                image input. Images need to use a width and height attribute. Use the image logo_ywca_32by32.png.
                It is a 32px by 32px square.
            </p>
            <p>

                to enter their favorite fruit using a text input. Create a predefined list of options they can 
                choose from using a datalist element and at least 3 options. Make sure the <i>list</i> attribute of
                the input element is the same as the id of the datalist. Set the autocomplete attribute to on.
